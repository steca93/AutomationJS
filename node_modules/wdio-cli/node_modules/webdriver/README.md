Webdriver
=========

This will be soon the official Node.JS Webdriver bindings.

## History

Webdriver was originated by [Camilo Tapia's](https://github.com/camme) initial
Selenium project called WebdriverJS, which was the first webdriver project on NPM.
In 2014, the project was renamed WebdriverIO later on. Since XXX it was renamed again
to Webdriver and will be the official binding for NodeJS.
